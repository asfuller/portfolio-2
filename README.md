# [Alex Fuller Portfolio Site](https://asfuller.github.io/portfolio-2/)
Hello, my name is Alex Fuller and this is my portfolio site.

Here, you can view my past and current projects, resume, and more about me.

If you would like to work with me on a project, you can fill out the contact form and I will reach you as soon as I can.

## Bug Fixes & Design 👷🏾‍♀️
This was a quick start project that I wanted ready to show in a very short amount of time, so there are many bugs that will be fixed.
I am currently working on the nav menu design to make it more sleek and adding more current projects.

## Current Projects 🚧
Right now, I am learning AI Fundamentals. I am relearning Python so that I can advance my Web App skills and introduce AI into my work.
